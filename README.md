Snake Game AI

This project is a classic Snake Game built using Python's Pygame library, enhanced with an AI agent that learns to play the game. The AI uses reinforcement learning techniques to navigate and play the Snake Game autonomously. The repository includes the game logic, AI agent, and supporting modules.

Features

 - Classic Snake game mechanics.
 - AI-based agent that learns to play Snake using reinforcement learning.
 - Customizable game speed and dimensions.
